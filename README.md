# Spring-ATM

I Used SpringBoot
- Spring Security
- SpringBoot Web
- MVC
- Thymeleaf
- Spring Data JPA
- Database H2 (In Memory)

-> Because of how i configured the application it should run streight out of the box.
For the testing part ( i just tested all the scenarios i thought about and created some corner-cases
because i have not written tests that much ,but i can learn that too)
